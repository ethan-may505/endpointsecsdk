(**) We are relying on AVG's API, which does NOT come configured with the product by default:
		- The first time any of these functions are called by MDES SDK on a specific machine with an AVG product, they may return WAAPI_ERROR_INVALID_STATE. 
		- This kick-starts the AVG product to silently download and install the API. During this time, certain components of the product may disable/re-enable breifly, and the GUI may restart itself. After these events all functions should begin returning correct results. On a fast machine this entire process takes around 1-2 minutes. On a slow machine this process can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes.
