    Detailed documentation of the MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK V4, user guides, FAQ's etc. Refer to this documentation
    for all of your integration needs.
    
### docs/sample_code ###

    Sample MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK V4 integrations in different languages.
    
### docs/support_charts ###

    Information on the currently supported products in the MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK V4. The support_charts.html provides a user friendly
    view of the content in raw_json.js and the package structure is important for the page to render properly.
    The raw_json.js file contains the JSON formatted text for the support charts. It is written in the form of a
    JavaScript file to ensure it can be loaded locally by browsers. Removing the initial assignment text
    of "SUPPORT_CHARTS = " will leave the file as pure JSON, which can then be read by a JSON parser.
