==========================================

Overview
--------

OPSWAT's framework for software manageability is written in C++ with a C 
integration point. This file gives a brief introduction to the package
content. For details on the framework, please see the HTML documentation 
found here:

Requirements for integrators
----------------------------
MDES SDK V4 is designed as a very light weight framework for software and network
manageability. Currently, we support the Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.
Please refer to the minimum deployment dependencies for integrating MDES SDK V4.

### bin ###

    Contains the libraries and resources for integrating the MDES SDK V4.
    The following dlls are required for ALL deployments (found in the detection directory):
        libwaapi.dll
        libwaheap.dll
        libwautils.dll
    The following files are required for offline deployments:
        libwaresource.dll
        
    All files found in each of the module directories, such as manageability, are required to use that module's functionality. These modules
    allow the addition of extended MDES SDK functionality.
        
### docs/html ###

    Detailed documentation of the MDES SDK V4, user guides, FAQ's etc. Refer to this documentation
    for all of your integration needs.
    
### docs/sample_code ###

    Sample MDES SDK V4 integrations in different languages.
    
### docs/support_charts ###

    Information on the currently supported products in the MDES SDK V4. The support_charts.html provides a user friendly
    view of the content in raw_json.js and the package structure is important for the page to render properly.
    The raw_json.js file contains the JSON formatted text for the support charts. It is written in the form of a
    JavaScript file to ensure it can be loaded locally by browsers. Removing the initial assignment text
    of "SUPPORT_CHARTS = " will leave the file as pure JSON, which can then be read by a JSON parser.

### inc ###

    Contains the header files for integrating the MDES SDK V4. 
    
### lib ###

    Contains the library files for implicit dynamic linking.

### OSSLicense ###
    
    Information on the open source software used for the core functionality of MDES SDK V4.
